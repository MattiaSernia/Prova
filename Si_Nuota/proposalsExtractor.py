            (the documents written BY a bidding consortium IN RESPONSE to a public Call for Tenders).

            Your SOLE task is to extract PROPOSALS (commitments made by the bidder) from a given sentence.
            You must completely IGNORE rephrasings of the client's needs, background context, and
            generic marketing claims that do not commit the bidder to anything concrete.

            ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
            WHAT IS A PROPOSAL?
            ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

            A PROPOSAL expresses something the consortium (or the solution it proposes)
            WILL DO, WILL DELIVER, GUARANTEES, COMPLIES WITH, OFFERS or INCLUDES.
            It is a concrete commitment of the bidder towards the contracting authority.

            Ask yourself: "Is the bidder taking responsibility for something concrete here?"
            → YES → it is a PROPOSAL → extract it.
            → NO  → it is context, a restatement of the client's need, or filler → ignore it.

            PROPOSALS typically contain verbs such as:
            propose, commit to, will deliver, will provide, provide, deliver, include,
            guarantee, comply with, host, integrate, support, ensure, certify,
            cover, address, implement, offer, use, deploy, build.

            ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
            WHAT IS NOT A PROPOSAL? (IGNORE THESE)
            ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

            Ignore anything that does not commit the bidder to something concrete:
            - Rephrasings of the client's need
              ("The City wants to improve administrative services")
            - Generic marketing claims with no deliverable
              ("We are leaders in AI for the public sector")
            - Background descriptions of the consortium
              ("Our company was founded in 2005 and has 120 employees")
            - Pure transitions / section introductions
              ("In this section we describe our technical approach")
            - Tender requirements quoted verbatim without a corresponding commitment
              ("The tender requires 99.9% availability")

            ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
            OUTPUT FORMAT
            ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

            For each proposal found, output exactly one line in this format:
            [subject | predicate | object]

            Field definitions:
            1. subject   (MANDATORY) — Who commits. Typically "the consortium",
                                        "the proposed solution", or one of its components
                                        (e.g. "our hosting infrastructure", "the chatbot module").
                                        MUST NOT be the contracting authority.
            2. predicate (MANDATORY) — The commitment verb, written as an active form
                                        (e.g. "commits to host", "will deliver", "provides",
                                        "guarantees", "complies with", "integrates with").
            3. object    (MANDATORY) — The concrete deliverable, figure, certification,
                                        capability or scope being committed.

            Output ONLY the tuple lines. No numbering, no prose, no explanation.
            If a sentence contains no proposal at all, output nothing.""")

            Your SOLE task is to extract CONSTRAINTS from a given sentence.
            You must completely IGNORE business needs, goals, and desired outcomes.

            ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
            WHAT IS A CONSTRAINT?
            ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

            A CONSTRAINT expresses HOW or UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS the solution must operate.
            It is non-negotiable and restricts the space of acceptable solutions.

            Ask yourself: "Is this sentence imposing a limit, a rule, or a mandatory condition?"
            → YES → it is a CONSTRAINT → extract it.
            → NO  → it is a goal or desired outcome → ignore it.

            CONSTRAINTS typically concern:
            - Budget limits          (maximum cost, price ceiling, annual expenditure)
            - Time or duration       (contract length, deadlines, delivery dates)
            - Technical requirements (performance thresholds, uptime, response time, formats)
            - Regulatory compliance  (laws, norms, standards: GDPR, ISO, WCAG, NIS2...)
            - Infrastructure rules   (hosting location, cloud certification, on-premise)
            - Sovereignty / data     (no transfer outside a territory, national hosting)
            - Environmental rules    (emission standards, energy consumption limits)
            - Candidate qualifications (certifications, turnover, insurance)
            - Security requirements  (encryption, access control, audit trails)

            ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
            WHAT IS NOT A CONSTRAINT? (IGNORE THESE)
            ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

            Ignore anything that describes a desired capability, improvement, or outcome:
            - "The system should help users find information faster"
            - "The goal is to reduce processing time"
            - "The solution must provide an intelligent assistant to staff"
            - "The authority wants to improve service quality"

            ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
            OUTPUT FORMAT
            ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

            For each constraint found, output exactly one line in this format:
            [constraintType | subject | predicate | object]

            Field definitions:
            1. constraintType (OPTIONAL) — You MUST use ONLY one of these exact values if applicable:
                                            "Budgetary"    — cost, price, financial limits
                                            "Temporal"     — duration, deadlines, schedule
                                            "Technical"    — performance, formats, uptime, standards
                                            "Regulatory"   — legal norms, compliance obligations
                                            "Environmental"— energy, emissions, carbon footprint
                                            "Sovereignty"  — data location, territorial restrictions
                                            Leave blank if none apply, but KEEP the pipe.
            2. subject   (MANDATORY) — The entity being constrained.
            3. predicate (MANDATORY) — The limiting verb or state (e.g. "must be", "is limited to",
                                        "must comply with", "shall not exceed", "is required to have").
            4. object    (MANDATORY) — The exact limit, value, standard, or condition imposed.

            Output ONLY the tuple lines. No numbering, no prose, no explanation.
            If a sentence contains no constraint at all, output nothing.""")
